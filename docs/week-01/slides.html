<!-- Introduction to AI and ML: what is --> 
  <div>
    <p>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</p>
  </div>

  <div> 
Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence: what is the connection and the difference?
</div>

    <div> 
  - AI is the broader concept of enabling a machine or system to sense, reason, act, or adapt like a human 
       <br />   
  - ML is a subfield of AI (that allows machines to extract knowledge from data and learn from it autonomously)
</div>

<div>
- More on the  <a href=" https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/history"> origin of 'AI' </a> 
<br />  
- More on the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"> origin of 'ML' </a> 
 
</div>

      
  <div>
    <h2>What is intelligence? 🤨</h2>
    <p > It includes the ability to learn, solve complex problems or make decisions with outcomes benefiting the actor</p>
    <p > and many more...</p>
  </div>

    <div>
    <h2>Is intelligence exclusive to human? 🤨</h2>
    <p > <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals#:~:text=Chimpanzees%20are%20sophisticated%20tool%20users,in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Congo"> A gorilla that uses a stick to test depth of water</a>, 
  <br /> 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B91tozyQs9M"> A fish that makes art</a>,
  <br /> 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKQK7EIcq9Y"> A dog that talks with buttons</a> </p>
  </div>

        <div>
    <p>Intelligence is always specific, most of time we are talking about human intelligence 
<br />          
(for simplicity, we omit human in the rest of slides)</p>
  </div>

              <div>
    <p>My take on intelligence:
<br />             
Intelligence is hard to define and it may include learning, task solving in a complex environment and art making capability. 
<br />          
Thinking about intelligence is a way of appreciation.
<br />    
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">Simple things are hard.</a> </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Let's move on to artificial intelligence...</h2>
  </div>

    <p>Engineering science:

    <p>Natural science:
          <br />    
        discover and explain phenomena🧪💯 — curiosity satisfied ✌️</p>
  </div>

<div>
  <p>
These two subjects can be intertwined. 
<br /> 
So does AI! 
  </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p> AI is a tool (as a part of engineering science🔭)
    <br />     
      For instance, we can use AI models to translate languages and break the barriers.   
  </p>

  <p> AI is also our attempt to understand intelligence better (as a part of natural science🧠)

<!-- Introduction to ML: applications  --> 
<div>
    <h4>Before diving into what ML models are and how they work, let's look at it from the other way: </h4>
    <p > What can ML models do? </p>
  
    <p > ML applications are mainly from two categories: </p>
  
  <p > Pattern recognition (more on this later) </p>
  <p > Pattern generation (what most "popular" AI models are doing nowadays) </p>

      <h4> The significance of pattern recognition to humanity </h4>
    <blockquote>
      &ldquo; We distinguished predator from prey; and poisonous plants from nourishing ones - enhancing our chance to live and reproduce, and passing on our genes. 
      We used pattern recognition in astronomy and astrology, where different cultures, recognizing the patterns of stars in the skies, projected different symbols and pictures for constellations.&rdquo;

</div>

  <!-- Introduction to ML: how we learn  --> 
      <div>
  <h4>Here is a formal definition of ML by Tom Mitchell</h4>       
    <p>A computer program is said to learn from experience <b>E</b> with respect to some class of tasks <b>T</b> and performance measure <b>P</b>, 
      <br> 
      if its performance at tasks in <b>T</b>, as measured by <b>P</b>, improves with experience <b>E</b>.</p>
    <p > I can't memorise this paragraph, but here are some fun connections I draw on how WE learn throughout this unit😎 </p>
    <p > We'll resume to machine learning shortly 🤘😎 </p>
</div>

            <div>   
  <h4>⚡️Cross-disciplinary slide 01: how do we learn?</h4>       
    <p > <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32018-9#Sec14"> Repeated exposure</a> (like Experience <b>E</b> that ML model learns from) </p>
    <p > It is absolutely fine if something from this unit looks like a hard bite at first sight. We have amazing perceptual adaptation capability that can carry us over through repeated exposure. </p>

<h4>⚡️Cross-disciplinary slide 03: how do we learn?</h4>

<p > Some important AI developments are inspired by how we think our brain works, e.g. the attention mechanism that enables ChatGPT. (more on this in week 8) 🧠 </p> 
<p > Some intuitions on ML can be gained just by introspection. I'll help by sharing mine.  </p> 
<p > Though intuitions are not formal knowledge, they connect you from academic jargons to daily real life!👽 </p>

    <p > 🧠:⭐️⭐️⭐️ (but we need to know why we are splitting the dataset)</p>

                  <div>
  <h2>Model Selection 🧐</h2>  
    <p>Depends on the defined problem, select what models you want to train and test. </p>
      <p > 🧠:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (knowing your options aka models and their characteristics is essential)</p> 
      <p > 👐:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (knowing how to train and use models in practice is also essential)</p> 
</div>
                  <div>
  <h2>Model Training 🏋️</h2>  
    <p>Use the training dataset to train the ML model.</p>
      <p > 👐:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️(this step is quintessential, though usually done with several lines of codes)</p> 
    <p > 🧠:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (knowing how the training process works is also quintessential)</p> 
    
</div>
                  <div>
  <h2>Candidate Model Evaluation 🧪</h2>  
    <p>Assess the performance of the candidate models using validation dataset to see how well these models perform. </p> 
      <p > 👐:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (this step is very practical and automated, by looking at some numbers)</p> 
  </div>
                  <div>
  <h2>Model Deployment 🎉</h2>  
    <p>Once the best model is chose, it is typically deployed via some API and embedded in some frameworks to put into real world.</p>

      <p > 👐:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (this step is very practical)</p> 
      <p > 🧠:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (nice user interface design would be fabulous, etc.)</p> 
  </div>
  
                  <div>
  <h2>Performance Monitoring 📈</h2>  
    <p> The model is continuously monitored to observe how it behaved in the real world and calibrated accordingly.</p>
    <p> New data is collected to incrementally improve it.</p>
      <p > 👐:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (this step is very practical)</p>
